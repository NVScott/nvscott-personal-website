                    Hey, I'm Nessa. I'm what happens when you can't decide between a going into a field that's technical, people-oriented, or creative -- you pick one that's all three.

                    Human-Computer Interaction is understanding the cognitive science behind the design. It's knowing who your users are, finding out what they want and need, and finding
                    ways to fulfill those needs that are efficient, intuitive, and elegant. It's a lot more than a good color scheme and pretty typography, crucial as those are.
                    It's predicting mistakes, and designing your app to flow in a way that makes them rare.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's not just research and principles, though. Beyond personas, wifeframes, and heuristic evaluations I've got technical skills, too.
                    I'm comfortable using python, html5, css, javascript (plus common tools like jquery, bootstrap, angular, and ionic). I'm also familiar with data-visualization
                    tools and techniques, non-relational databases, and working with huge datasets to tell a story. I have had training in project management, and done groupwork
                    with groups of many sizes, as both leader and subordinate. I also am currently doing research on the ethics of privacy and data-collection. I am mostly interested
                    in UI design, but enjoy discovering, researching, and designing all elements of the user experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Check out my Projects page to see my research, mockups, and designs.
                    Feel free to review my resume, and drop me an email or call. Thanks!
                </p>

                            I'm a 24 year old senior at UCI, majoring in Informatics and specializing in Human Computer Interaction. Compulsive doodler, hobbyist to-do-lister.
                            I go to board-game conventions on my birthday. I make visualizations of my own personal data for fun. I appreciate bad movies, enjoy horror movies, and love combinations of the two.
                            There is an 80% chance that I am listening to a podcast right now, as you're reading this. I once went to Corgi Beach Day and didn't pet any dogs, because they all seemed really busy and I didn't want to inconvenience them.
                            In my spare time, I enjoy playing ukulele, experimenting with 3d rendering, and trying to come up with the best way to describe myself on the internet.
