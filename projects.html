                    <p>
                        Over Summer 2018 I got the opportunity to work with Professor Matthew Bietz on his research projects,
                        grouped together under the name <em>Pervasive Data Ethics for Computational Research</em>, shortened to
                        <a href="https://pervade.umd.edu/">PERVADE</a>. Their goals are multifaceted, and their website explains them
                        more eloquently than I could, so I'll just quote the section we have been focusing on:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote cite="https://pervade.umd.edu/about/technical-investigations/">
                        "One of the most persistent challenges for pervasive computing researchers and ethicists alike is quantifying
                        the risk posed by pervasive datasets to data subjects and communities. ... This sub-project will draw on empirical
                        and mathematical assessments to develop clearer metrics for inference risk. ...  This will allow researchers and regulators
                        to characterize, and perhaps quantify, risk in terms of the sensitivity of the inferred attributes, the accuracy of inference,
                        the time period over which the inference would become feasible, and other factors."
                        <footer><a href="https://pervade.umd.edu/about/technical-investigations/">PERVADE on Technical Investigations</a></footer>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        To summarize, their goal is to educate and inform researchers on the ethics of pervasive data collection. Hopefully, in time,
                        our policies will reflect careful thought and regulation of our data.

                    <p>
                        Our work is still in its early stages, so most of my work was a prototype rather than a final product. We wanted
                        to use Google Takeout data and see if we could visualize it in a meaningful way.
                        We came up with some different options, like comparing what you searched at your Work location and
                        what you searched at your Home location, or matching up search terms with spotify history by time to see if we could
                        determine mood, or matching google shopping lists and location history to determine their shopping frequency, et cetera.
                        Ultimately, for proof of concept we decided to visualize their search history on a map and show the most searched term
                        by state (and when zoomed in, county). We also wanted to make a wordcloud that showed the top-50 searched
                        words by state, to get an idea of what you're searching on Google.

                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oBRauoh.png" id="dataviz" class="img-fluid center-block" alt="map and wordcloud of most searched terms">

                        I had never used javascript or d3 prior to this project, but I picked it up in about two weeks to create this project.
                        Some things are still not perfect (the wordcloud was the last thing we added and it sometimes doesn't lay out correctly)
                        but it got to a point where Matt could use it as a sample to give to a dedicated team to work on. I will be able to
                        continue working with Matt this year on his research, doing less coding and more HCI-focused work. We're currently doing literary reviews,
                        and have plans to work on surveys and interviews this quarter. I'll keep updating it as we work!

                        This was a 10-week long project where a team of 5 picked an app with a flawed design and tried to improve it using the skills we know.
                        We picked Sleep as Android when two of our members showed up late to our first meeting because of it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>but first, research.</h2>
                    <p>
                        We started with heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs, using the app, pointing out where the information was confusing,
                        instructions unclear, and status of the process unknown. Next we did research on our user -- we sent out surveys finding out who was interested
                        in sleep tracking, why, and how do they want to track themselves. From there, we did deeper interviews directly with some of our survey-participants,
                        really getting in depth with how they sleep, what they would want to track, and what are their habits. The results that we found: generally, if people
                        are interested in sleep-tracking, it's because they're already tracking other health metrics, and almost universally, people's sleeping habits are
                        really, <em>really</em> different. So customizability and freedom was going to be a huge component of our redesign. We used card-sorting to group the
                        main sentiments and used them to create personas, like this one.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="resources/projects/sleep-as-android/affinity.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                        <img src="resources/projects/sleep-as-android/persona.png" class="img-fluid">
                        From our early evaluations, we had a few ideas about where people were tripping up, and when we surveyed if people had tried sleep-tracking before,
                        many had, but most had stopped after just 1 or 2 uses. Some users had even tried Sleep as Android specifically, but almost no one had continued
                        using it for an extended period. We suspected that Sleep as Android's tutorial was insufficient and that confusion was causing people to download
                        the app, use it once, and then give up. This was confirmed when we performed usability tests with brand new users, and watched almost all of them
                        fail to set up an alarm, set expected sleep income, begin sleep tracking, and then save their sleep-tracking data. In a real world setting, they would
                        have failed to wake up on time, or failed to save their sleep data, and they probably wouldn't try a second time. This was NOT a fault of our users,
                        but the app's lack of explanation. After all, here's a sample of the original tutorial:
                        <img src="/resources/projects/sleep-as-android/originaltutorial.png" class="img-fluid">
                        12 slides describing what features exist, but not how to do them. No wonder users were confused.</p>


                    <h2>low, medium, & high fidelity mockups.</h2>
                    <p>
                        We identified the main problems as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>ineffective first-time tutorial</strong></li>
                            <em>Fix: discoverable menu that provides 'just in time' pop-ups for each setting and option.</em>
                            <li><strong>cluttered hamburger menu</strong></li>
                            <em>Fix: Reorganize hamburger menu with category headings so users can narrow down what they're looking for</em>
                            <li><strong>overwhelming graphs, some of which seem unnecessary</strong></li>
                            <em>Fix: Simplify which graphs are shown, clearly label the axes, organize the page to show fewer graphs at once</em>
                            <li><strong>settings menus are all over the place</strong></li>
                            <em>Fix: Combine all settings into one master settings menu and use clear headers and tabs to make it easier to navigate.</em>
                            <li><strong>the sleep-tracking page is confusing</strong></li>
                            <em>Fix: Limit to page to only absolutely key features, remove clutter, and make it obvious when sleep tracking begins and ends.</em>
                        </ul>

                        The biggest issue was that the tutorial provided was both overly long and entirely inadequate at explaining on how to do something.
                        We grouped together and did many quick sketches with different options to solve the problem including
                        Ultimately, we decided to do away with the opening tutorial entirely, and replace it with just small markers on each page that would bring up a broad tutorial for that page.  The main key features were as follows:
                        Our design should have discoverable tutorials that the user can view at their own pace
                        Broad tutorials for larger topics are available on the main pages with a large button.
                        There should be a small tutorial or explanation on any setting that is new compared to your average default alarm clock.
                        Rather than videos, small looping animations that show the process would give the user a visual without boring them or asking them to commit to a video.
                        The help icons would disappear after the first viewing, but an option in the settings would allow them to be always on, always off, or to reset your progress in it.
